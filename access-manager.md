# PubNub Access Manager (PAM)

PubNub Access Manager (PAM) provides fine-grained access controls to PubNub
Data Streams and DataSync Objects. It presents a minimal REST API for secure
administration tasks, and transparently protects Data Stream and DataSync
resource access. This document divides these two responsibilities clearly into
their own sections; REST API, and ACL Enforcement.

## Request Format

    HTTP GET
     
    https://pubsub.pubnub.com/v1/auth/grant/sub-key/{subscribe-key}?signature=<sign>&auth={auth-key}
    
    

#### Computing the Signature for Request - <sign> QS Param

`<sign>` is computed using ```HMAC+SHA256``` with the user's ```secret key``` as the 
signing key, and the request string as the message. The request string is composed of
the request query parameters concatenated to the subscribe key, publish key, and
method (`grant`, `revoke`, or `granted`) in the following format string:

    "{sub_key}\n{pub_key}\n{method}\n{query_string}"

Here is a full example message:

    {subscribe-key}
    {publish-key}
    grant
    auth={auth-key}&channel=my_channel&r=1&w=1&timestamp=123456789&ttl=1440

##### Required Formatting

* Query string parameters must be sorted lexicographically (case-sensitive) by
key. 

* Secondly, all characters in the query string parameters must be
percent-encoded *except* alphanumeric, hyphen, underscore, and period; E.g. all
characters matching the RegExp `/[^0-9a-zA-Z\-_\.]/`. 

* Space characters must be replaced by `%20` (NOT `+` character). 

* Each key-value pair must be separated by ampersand characters. 

* Unicode characters must be broken up into UTF-8 encoded bytes before percent-encoding.

Here is an example of a query string containing unicode characters:

    auth=joker&r=1&w=1&ttl=60&timestamp=123456789&PoundsSterling=Â£13.37

And here is the same query string after sorting and percent-encoding:

    PoundsSterling=%C2%A313.37&auth=joker&r=1&w=1&timestamp=123456789&ttl=60


Let's imagine the demo account's secret key is:

    wMfbo9G0xVUG8yfTfYw5qIdfJkTd7A

The signature generated for this request is Base64 encoded using the "URL safe"
characters `-` and `_` replacing `+` and `/` respectively:

    v2rgQQ1eFzk8omugFV9V1_eKRUvvMv9jyC9Z-L1ogdw=

This signature is then percent-encoded according to standard query parameter
percent-encoding practices. E.g. the `=` character is transformed into `%3D`.

    }
